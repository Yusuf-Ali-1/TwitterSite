# TwitterSite

#After launching in 2006, Twitter has become the go-to platform for real-time news and updates. 
#Users can see tweets on trending topics or international events, written by the people who have something to share, anywhere in the world.

#We’ll start off by thinking about the main pages that a site like Twitter needs in order to provide the features your users will expect from a fast-paced social network. 
#These pages will act as the primary interface that your users will use to post updates and make them available to your platform’s community.
